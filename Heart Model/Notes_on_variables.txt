Notes:
---
Atrium depolarizes, then there is a conduction delay which then reaches the ventricle which then depolarizes.
Depolarize, conduction, ventricle polarizes

For timed automata, you need: {clock, resets, and action (messages)}

**In the timed automata, the timers are running in parallel; therefore, during fuzzing we need to make sure that the secondary (ventricle) trigger is sufficiently longer than the atrium one



Variables:
---
Act_node (activate node signal)
Act_path (activate path signal)

Rest_def (rest timer)
ERP_def 
Tcond_def (value for the conduction delay count down, after which the path signals)
RRP_def 

LRI_def (VA <= LRI-AVI)
	AVI is equal to an a-to-v timer
	LRI is essentially the V to V timer (see treat the symptoms 2: Oct 18)
